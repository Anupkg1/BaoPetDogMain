I wanted to build a Pet Robot Dog for my daughter. She loves dogs and would love to have a pet dog. 
Dog responds to "Hi Bao" and "Hi Ping" for  names.
As part of this contest deadline I am submitting my project AS IS but I am going to continue on this and complete remaining features.   

a) Face Recognition: Bao will detect registered faces and greet them.
b) Offline Voice Commands: Bao responds to commands like go front, go back, turn etc.
c) Chat bot : Bao will be like Alexawhere you can interact with it.
d) Assistant : Bao can be a personal assistant with alarms and reminders. 
e) Friendly Face: Bao will use a display to show its mood and perform random actions. 
Bao is built on 3d printed custom chassis. The chassis is multi layer. The below deck is for mobility and top deck is for power bank and AI.

I hope she will like it when this is fully ready.

=========================================================

In this Repo there are following directories :

1) 3dFiles : STL Files to 3d print chassis parts, motor brackets and Pan / Tilt system.
2) AI_ThinkerVC02 : This has the binary files fro V02 module for offline Commands.
3) ESP32 : This has the Arduino IDE files(*.ino) required for ESP32.
4) MaixDuino : Required python files for Face detection and other features.
